"""
Preprocessing script for the weather dataset. It performs cleaning and preparation of the dataset focusing only on the columns that
can be replicated through the sensors: temperature, humidity, and pressure. The goal is to create a consistent dataset with no missing values,
ready to be used by the predictive model.

Operations performed:
- Loading the dataset from a CSV file
- Selecting the columns of interest (features and target)
- Removing null values and converting data to numeric format
- Ensuring the target is binary (0 or 1)
- Saving the cleaned dataset to a file

Output: A new CSV file with cleaned data, ready for analysis or model training.
